        the first element index is 0

        // The same idea with number objects:

        // My other operating system is "Mac OS"

        // first formula: find the total => Using the long way! (We SHOULD use loop to find the total)
        let total = myLuckyNumbers[0] + myLuckyNumbers[1] + myLuckyNumbers[2] + myLuckyNumbers[3] + myLuckyNumbers[4] + myLuckyNumbers[5];

        // We can create an empty array and insert its values later:
        // like working with variables:

        myNum1 = 100;
        let myNum2 = 200; // var myNum2=200;

        // In Arrays:
        // Declare an empty array:
        var myBooks = [];
        // Or:
        var myPrograms = new Array();

        // To put/insert the values, we can use the index syntax for now:
        myBooks[0] = "Beginning JavaScript";
        myBooks[1] = "Adobe Dreamweaver";
        myBooks[2] = "HTML and CSS Web Design";

        myPrograms[0] = "MS Office";
        myPrograms[1] = "DMWD";
        myPrograms[3] = "FSSD";

        // Later we will use the array method for inserting elements to the array:

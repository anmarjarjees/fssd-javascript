Problem:
The user bought x items and they need to know the total price for these items
and also print the item price list

Required Steps:
1- Ask the user to input how many items did they buy?
  and save it into a variable

2- We need to loop for x of times based on the number of items

3- In each loop iteration (looping for x number of times):
 a. we ask the user to enter the price of the current item
 b. Each price value has to be saved into an array
 (So we need to declare an empty array before the loop starts)
 c. Adding the prices to a variable "total"

4- Output (print) the arrays that contains the prices

5- Output the total value of adding all the items' prices
*/

        /*
          Task1:
          Create an array based on the user input named "userList"
          - The user has to insert a list of numbers => save it into an array
          - We need to know first, how many numbers the user need to insert
          to help us set a for loop to keep ask the user the same question

          with prompt:
          if the user inputs ABC = "ABC"
          if the user inputs 123 = "123"
        */

        var numOfItems = parseInt(prompt("How many items did you buy?"));
        // Example User Input => 4:  prompt => "4" => parseInt => 4

        console.log(numOfItems);

        // declare the array "userList" to the price of each item
        // this array will be populated on the fly (loop)
        let userList = []; // We just need to declare an empty array

        // so if the user input 4, we need to loop 4 times
        // if user input any number, we need to loop based on that number
        // we need to loop for 4 times to ask the user to enter the prices of their four items:

        var i; // the loop counter variable, this will be the global variable to be used with any loop
        // or using let i;
        // since we don't have to use i as the array index
        // we can set its initial value to 1 (to count from 1 as we do in our normal life)
        for (i = 1; i <= numOfItems; i++) {
            // We can summarize our code into just one line
            // in this way we don't have to declare new variable named "currentItemPrice"
            userList.push(parseFloat(prompt("Enter the price for item " + i + ": ")));

        let tempList = [];
        for (i = 1; i <= numOfItems; i++) {
            currentItem = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the price for item " + i + ": "));
            userList.push(currentItem);
        }

        3 items prices: 89, 90, 56
        in the array:
        index 0 ==> 89
        index 1 ==> 90
        index 2 ==> 56

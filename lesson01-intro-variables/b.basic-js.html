    <!-- To write JS inside HTML file we use script element to write JavaScript -->

    <!-- 
    Note: In the old days (before HTML 5), we used to add the attribute "type="text/javascript" 
    to specify that the scripting language is JavaScript, 
    but with the HTML5 document no need to add this attribute.
	
    We used to have another scripting language from Microsoft
    named "Visual Basic Script or VB Script" 
    but this language "VBS" was working only on Microsoft Internet Explorer Browser 
    so it became obsolete sooner

    <script type="text/JavaScript">
    </script>

    The only 2 ways to run/execute a JS code:
    1- Writing our code inside our HTML file in between the script element
    - either inside the <head> part
    - either inside the <body> part
    Or
    2- Write our code in separate (external) js file and attach/link this js file 
    to our current HTML file
    -->
    <script>
        alert("I am your text inside the head and the body")
    </script>
</head>

<body>
 <h1 id=main class=major>Test Heading</h1>
     <!-- We should place our script either inside the head or the body in the html file -->
     <script>
        // it has to be alert()
        // Alert("another test"); // error: Alert is not defined
           /*
               To check our JavaScript error we need to open the console window
           */
           alert("Hello again from the body element");
           
           /*
           Although adding ";" at the end is optional in JS
           but we should add ";" always for more clarification
           */
           alert(5 + 3); // 8
           alert(4 / 2); // 2
           alert(7 * 2); // 14
           alert(5 - 3); // 2

           /*
        We used alert() => it's a built-in JS function (it comes with JS)

        name() ==> function or method
		functionName() 
		methodName() 
		
		above and below we are using a JavaScript built-in function!!!
		built-in ==> native to JavaScript language itself
		
		example:
		alert() => is native/built-in function/method
		each function has to have "(" and ")"
		whether its empty or not we have to add them

		Please be advised that JavaScript is Case Sensitive
		so alert() is not like Alert()
		and it's not like ALERT()

<!-- 
    Placing my script outside the body element (our outside the head)
    will generate this error in W3 Validator:
    Error: Stray start tag script
-->
<script>
    alert("I am your text from the alert outside the body element!")

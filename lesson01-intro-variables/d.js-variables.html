            Variable is just a container inside the Computer Memory (RAM)
            Random Access Memory that contains some data.

            it's a place to hold some data temporarily while the file still running

        // we need to declare the variable before start using it using the keyword "var"
        // var variableName;
        var x;  // we are not giving x any data or value! 

        // let's try to alert the variable x:
        // remember that x has no value
        alert(x); // undefined

        // after declaring a variable, we can start using it
        x = 1;

        alert(y); // 2

        // alert => x+y -> 1+2
        alert(x + y); // 3

        // initialize num1 variable:
        var num1 = 100; // in one simple step

        // declare num2 variable first, and give it a value later:
        var num2;
        num2 = 200;

        // I need to find the total of these two variables num1 and num2:
        // and save the result into another variable named "result":

        Task:
        Simple program to calculate the total price of my 4 textbooks.

        Assume you have 4 textbooks
        first book is $40.75
        second book is $72.45
        third book is $54.28
        fourth book is $57.31
        */

        // Part 1:
        // we can create/declare and initialize a new variable for each book
        // this variable will hold price of the book
        // declare and initialize variables "book1", "book2", "book3", and "book4" for example:

        // We are just assign a fixed value to each variable using our code
        // it's called "Hard Coding the values"
        var book1 = 40.75;
        var book2 = 72.45;
        var book3 = 54.28;
        var book4 = 57.31;

        // Part 2: Output the total of the four variables:

        // First Solution:
        // we can use alert to alert/show/display the total :
        alert(book1 + book2 + book3 + book4); // 224.79000000000002

        // Second Solution:
        // or we can create a variable named total
        /*
        But if we need to save the total into a variable, 
        in this case we need to create a new variable in the computer memory, 
        this variable will be used to save the total of the 4 books
        */

        /*
         Maybe we want to use another variable name to make it more meaningful 
         to us as a programmer instead of just name it "total"  

         a name the contains three words => book price total
         
         Variable Naming Rules:
         1. No spaces, but we can use _ (in Python)
         2. We can't start with numbers
         3. We can't add special characters % ^ etc...

         In JS we have a naming convention that we should follow:
         is called "camelCase":

         in other programming languages like C#:
         they have "PascalCase" ==> MyFinalExam

         examples:
         a variable for full name => var fullName
         
         so please remember that it's just a naming convention for us as JS programmers
         - bookpricetotal
         - book_price_total
         - BookPriceTotal
         - BookpriceTotal
         - The one we should use ==> bookPriceTotal


         var bookPriceTotal;
         bookPriceTotal = book1 + book2 + book3 + book4;
       */

        // Instead of using two lines, below is just one line
        // We can declare and initialize at the same time:
        var bookPriceTotal = book1 + book2 + book3 + book4;
        alert(bookPriceTotal); // 224.79000000000002

        /*
        Besides using alert() function to output data to the browser window,
        We can output data in to the console window by using another function (method) named console.log()
        */

        // instead of using alert, we can use: console.log() JS method (function)
        // the result will be seen ONLY inside the console window
        // You can use the hot keys (PC): CTRL+SHIFT+J or I or F12 ==> Console window
        console.log(bookPriceTotal); // 224.79000000000002 in the console window
        /*
        Note: Remember that we, as programmers, use console.log to output our results,
        or testing our code but for the end-user we can use the alert function for the time being. Later in the next chapters we will learn another more user friendly function

            LMS Hint:
            The let keyword is the more modern way of declaring variables,
            so we recommend sticking with that.

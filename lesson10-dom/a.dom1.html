        Document Object Model (DOM): It's a Browser API
        
        Application Programming Interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions

        DOM: Document Object Model
        document represents this entire HTML page

        JS can control the web page (document)
     
         DOM is for parsing all the web page content (HTML elements),
         So we have to load or run our JS code after finishing loading the entire page 
         and that's why we usually place our code at the end after all the HTML elements
         (one of the main/major reasons)

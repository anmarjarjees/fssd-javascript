        /*
            Review:
            We used some methods of the built-in objects in JS:
            - the log() method of the console object:
              console.log("Hello World!");
            - the write() method of the document object:
              document.write("<h1>Heading 1</h1>");
    
            We used some properties of the built-in objects in JS:
            - document.title => will give us the document title
    
            to access our object members (properties and methods):
            - myObjectName.property
            - myObjectName.method()
    
            The syntax (template) to create our own/custom object:
            let/var objectName = {
                property1Name: property1Value,
                property2Name: property2Value,
                property3Name: property3Value,
            };
        */

        // literal notation 
        // creating our "car" object:
        // adding the owner of the car, name, year:
        // using array might not be clear!
        // let car = ['Martin','2017',4,'white', 30000];

        let car = {
            // if the property value is string, we have to enclose it with ' or "
            // Notice that this object contains properties only (no methods/function)
            /*
            Notice that each key-value pair is separated by a comma. 

            in this example:
            the key "owner" has the value of "Martin"
            the key "year" has the value of 2017

            The last key-value pair can have a trailing or hanging comma, but itâ€™s not necessary (optional).

            A value can be of any data type: boolean, function, string, integer and even other objects.

            } // end leaves property that has a value of object data type 
        } // end tree object

        // to check/test the object properties and methods:
        console.log(tree);

        // output the tree age:
        console.log(tree.age); // 101

        // output the leaves color: green
        // tree => leaves => color
        console.log(tree.leaves.color);


        // access the show function inside the object:
        tree.leaves.show();

        // delete/remove a property from an object:

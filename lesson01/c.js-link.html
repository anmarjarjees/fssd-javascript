    <h2>Linking to External JS file</h2>

    <!-- 
        The same idea as we linking to BS JS file
     -->
    <script src="script.js">
    </script>
    <!-- We still use the < script>
        </script> tags to load our external JavaScript files,
        but this time we need to supply the src attribute and the path to our file,
        or its URL.
        When you are creating your own JavaScript files,
        then it's good practice to put them in a folder or directory.
        Generally, we put them in a folder called js or scripts.

        We can use the console window in any browser to write our JS code:
 
        below are samples of what we have written in
        the console window:
    	
        Notes: 
        - To open the console window, we can use the hotkey F12 in the browser window
        - Notice that F12 is not the hotkey for ALL the browser
        - We can use our normal way: make right click with any browser then inspect then console
        - We can clear the console window (will not delete the history) by just typing this command [by running this function]:
        clear()

        // Double front slashes can be used for a single line of comments in JS

        // First function to print in JS console.log()
        // In JS everything is an object
        // object can have properties (specs in our life) and methods[functions] (actions in our life)
        // object-name.property-name or object-name.method-name()
        // Our first object to learn in JS is console
        // this object named "console" has a method (function) named log()
        // Like CSS any line in JS ends with ;
        // NOTE: the ; is optional in JS, yes it's valid to ignore, but NOT recommended 
        console.log(); // This will print/output nothing

        // below are examples from the code we wrote in the console

        // Using Numeric Values:
        console.log(100);
        console.log(100 + 200);
        console.log(2 * 5);

        // Using Text Values (String Data Type):
        console.log("JavaScript");
        console.log('Python');

        // The code below has this error: log is not defined
        // log('testin');

        // Find/output the total of two numbers 90 and 80:
        console.log(90 + 80);

        // Find/output the total of any two numbers:
        var number1 = 20000;
        var number2 = 19000;

        // Let's try first to print them to double check
        console.log("Number1 and Number2 Values:");
        console.log(number1); // 95
        // console.log(Number2); // Number2 is not defined
        console.log(number2); // 98

        // output the total directly:
        console.log("The total of number1 and number2:")
        console.log(number1 + number2);

        // Or we can assign the result of the total into another variable:
        var total = number1 + number2;
        console.log(total);

        // We can reuse the same variable again:
        // Let's try to take the average:

        console.log("The average of number1 and number2:")
        // First Solution:
        var average1 = (number1 + number2) / 2;
        console.log(average1);

        // Second Solution:
        var average2 = total / 2;
        console.log(average2);

        // Third Solution:
        console.log(total / 2);

        // document.write(average2); Just for fun :-) => for later lessons

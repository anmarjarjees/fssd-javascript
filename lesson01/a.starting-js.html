        We can use the console window in any browser to write our JS code:
 
        below are samples of what we have written in
        the console window:
    	
        Notes: 
        - To open the console window, we can use the hotkey F12 in the browser window
        - Notice that F12 is not the hotkey for ALL the browser
        - We can use our normal way: make right click with any browser then inspect then console
        - We can clear the console window (will not delete the history) by just typing this command [by running this function]:
        clear()
        */


        // Double front slashes can be used for a single line of comments in JS
        // here is another line of comment
        // here is also another line of comment

        // First function to print in JS console.log()
        // In JS everything is an object
        // object can have properties (specs in our life) and methods[functions] (actions in our life)
        // object-name.property-name or object-name.method-name()
        // Our first object to learn in JS is console
        // this object named "console" has a method (function) named log()
        // Like CSS any line in JS ends with ;
        // NOTE: the ; is optional in JS, yes it's valid to ignore, but NOT recommended 
        console.log(); // This will print/output nothing

        // below are examples from the code we wrote in the console

        // Using Numeric Values:
        console.log(100);
        console.log(100 + 200);
        console.log(2 * 5);

        // Using Text Values (String Data Type):
        console.log("JavaScript");
        console.log('Python');

        // The code below has this error: log is not defined
        // log('testin');

        // Find/output the total of two numbers 90 and 80:
        console.log(90 + 80);

        // Find/output the total of any two numbers:
        var number1 = 20000;
        var number2 = 19000;

        // Let's try first to print them to double check
        console.log("Number1 and Number2 Values:");
        console.log(number1); // 95
        // console.log(Number2); // Number2 is not defined
        console.log(number2); // 98

        // output the total directly:
        console.log("The total of number1 and number2:")
        console.log(number1 + number2);

        // Or we can assign the result of the total into another variable:
        var total = number1 + number2;
        console.log(total);

        // We can reuse the same variable again:
        // Let's try to take the average:

        console.log("The average of number1 and number2:")
        // First Solution:
        var average1 = (number1 + number2) / 2;
        console.log(average1);

        // Second Solution:
        var average2 = total / 2;
        console.log(average2);

        // Third Solution:
        console.log(total / 2);

        // document.write(average2); Just for fun :-) => for later lessons

        // More Examples about working with varaiables:
        // String, numbers, boolean
        var college = "Canadian Business College";
        var course = "JavaScript";
        var program = "FSSD";
        var campus = "Toronto";
        var studensNumber = 5;
        var modulesNumber = 12;
        var isValid = false;
        var isLegal = true;

        // We can also use the 'let' keywords:
        let age = 83;
        let province = "Ontario";

        // More Examples:
        /*
        PEDMAS = BEDMAS 
        P/B = ( )
        E = the power of 5 to the power of 2: 5x5=25
        D = /
        M = *
        A = +
        S = -
        */

        /*
        Built-in Function: is function that comes with the language itself
        Like in MS Excel, we have sum and average functions => we just need to know how to use them

        In JS:
        console.log() ==> using the function log() for "console object" to output anything to the console 

        another function named alert() belongs to the browser window ==> open a pop-up window inside "the browser window"

        "window" is a global object in JS

        Example:
        window.alert("Any Text Value")
        window.alert(any numeric value)
        */

        // below are examples from the code we wrote in the console
        window.alert("I am learning JavaScript");
        window.alert('testing        JS                  Spaces in alert     text  contents');
        window.alert(100);


        /*
        We can skip/ignore the object name "window"
        alert()

        Please be advised that JavaScript is Case Sensitive
        so alert() is not like Alert()
        and it's not like ALERT()
        */
        alert("One more example");

        // Using alert() to find the average of number1 and number2
        alert(number1 + number2 /2); // Wrong Answer
        alert((number1 + number2) /2);  // The right answer based on Math Rules

        /*
      notice below we are mixing " and '

      The idea: the whole sentence either:
      - starts and ends with " and use ' in between
      - starts and ends with ' and use " in between

      Example: Martin's car is Honda, John's car is Camry
      */

        // using alert() or console.log():
        alert("Martin's car is Honda, John's car is Camry");
        console.log('One of the most important language is "JavaScript"');

        // Martin's car is Honda, he likes SUV types of cars.
        console.log("Martin's car is Honda, he likes SUV types of cars.")

        /*
          What if we have a mixed sentence:
          Martin's car is Honda, he likes "SUV" type of cars.
  
          We can use the escape character: \ 
        */
        console.log('Martin\'s car is Honda, he likes "SUV" types of cars');
        // OR:
        console.log("Martin's car is Honda, he likes \"SUV\" types of cars");

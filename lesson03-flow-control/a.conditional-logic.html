        In JavaScript everything is considered truthy (true) except for:
        - false
        - undefined
        - null
        - Empty string: ""
        - Not a number: NaN
        - Zero: 0

        To check the truthiness or the falseness (true of false):
        - In JavaScript: Boolean(value)
        - In Python: bool(value) => www.pythontutor.com
        http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit

        JavaScript:
        By using the Boolean function: Determines if a value is true or false
        In a programming language, any value can ultimately be evaluated to true or false. 
        
        For example: 
        if a number is 0, null or an empty string, then it will be false.
